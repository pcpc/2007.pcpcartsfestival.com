      <title>Frequently Asked Questions</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[
            <h3>What are the eligibility requirements for the show?</h3>
            
            <p>The arts festival is open to all artists living in the area who are 18 years or older and present work based on the themes listed above.</p>
            
            <p>Generally, works will be accepted on paper, canvas, and fabric, as well as photography and sculpture. Crafts including jewelry, kits, copies, or prints will not be accepted.</p>
            
            <p>Work accepted must be appropriately framed and ready for wall mounting, not exceeding 48? in any direction.</p>
            
            <p>Glazing for works must be Plexiglas only.</p>
            
            <p>Sculpture footprint cannot be more than 36? x 36? and must be installed by the artist, with volunteer assistance if needed.</p>
            
            <h3>My artwork does not clearly fall within the media guidelines of the Call to Artists.  Will it be eligible for acceptance into the festival? </h3>
            
            <p>If it is original art based on the 23rd Psalm, yes it will be considered.</p>
            
            <h3>Will depictions of nudity be accepted into the festival?</h3>
            
            <p>Artwork considered generally offensive because of nudity or theme (pornographic, violent, or sacrilegious) will not be accepted.</p>
            
            <h3>Will non-traditional interpretations of the 23rd Psalm be considered?</h3>
            
            <p>Yes. We encourage all artists to sit down with the open Bible and listen to God and create artwork that comes out of that encounter.</p>
            
            <h3>I don’t have a computer.  Can I get help in registering online at www.callforentry.org? </h3>
            
            <p>Yes, you may call our Arts Festival phone number, 214-224-2813, and someone will call you back to take your information and register you online. You can also speak with an Arts Festival Committee member about online registration on Art Digital Day, <strong>February 16, 2006</strong>. </p>
            
            <h3>My art requires special handling. Will that be available?</h3>
            
            <p>Yes, there will be a volunteer there to help you unload your art.  Be sure to tell us what you need.</p>
            
            <h3>If my artwork sells, when will I be paid?</h3>
            
            <p>Just as soon as we can process the check.  Juror cash awards and People’s Choice Awards will be presented at the events.</p>
            
            <h3>What if my art is damaged or stolen?</h3>
            
            <p>You will be asked to sign a loan agreement when your art is delivered in which we pledge to use the same care with your art that the church uses with its own property.  Beyond that, the church has insurance that should cover any loss.</p>
            
            <h3>How many pieces will be accepted into the show?</h3>
            
            <p>We would like to have a minimum of 200 pieces but it could be much larger if quality art is submitted.</p>
            
            <h3>Will your church be planning future arts festivals?</h3>
            
            <p>Yes, it is our vision to have another arts festival next year and we would love to have your participation.</p>
            
            <h3>How will people dress for the arts festival?</h3>
            
            <p>The Pre-Exhibition Party on Thursday, May 3rd for artists and art patrons will be “dressy casual?; but everything else will be casual. </p>
            
            <h3>Will refreshments be served at the events?</h3>
            
            <p>Yes, we are planning to have refreshments at Digital Day and Art Delivery Day as well as the Pre-Exhibition Party and final Artists Reception.</p>
            
            <h3>The Call to Artists says this is not a fund raiser for the church. What will the money be used for?</h3>
            
            <p>If there are funds in excess of event expenses, it is our plan to use it for Purchase Awards for artists and we are considering investing in inner city art programs in the future. </p>
            
            <h3>This is a great idea. Where did it come from?</h3>
            
            <p>If you sit down and read Psalm 98 and 100, you will find that God wants to be praised. So we are just doing what He wants us to do. We are giving you a reason to create artwork about your faith, and creating a market for your art. </p>
